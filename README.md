# Developer-Portfolio

## Description

This page will be a place I can point future employers to, as well as prospective clients for my audio production clients.

## Installation

Clone this repo to your local host, and open the folder in the text editor of your choice. All needed assets are included.

## Usage

A profile page to showcase my web development projects.  The images and projects are just placeholders for what is to come.
Eventually the __Work__ section will link to examples of coding projects I have completed.
